Z-Force is a radio modem that can intercept and inject raw Z-Wave frames including encrypted packets to arbitrary destinations and Z-Wave Home IDs. It was developed during our research project on Z-Wave home automation systems which was presented in BlackHat 2013 USA conference. Z-Force toolkit consists of the following hardware and software components:

 * Two CC1110 RF transceivers used as receiver and transmitter interfaces
 * CC1110 chip Firmware that loosely implements Z-Wave physical and transport layers
 * Two USB to UART bridge to facilitate communication with RF boards over virtual COM ports
 * A GUI program written in C# that displays the intercepted Z-Wave frames and their payloads as well as enabling the user to replay a captured packet or send raw packets with arbitrary fields and payloads.

Setting up Z-Force hardware is straightforward: upload the RX and TX firmwares to receiver and transmitter CC1110 boards using [http://www.ti.com/tool/flash-programmer Texas Instruments SmartRF Flash Programmer] and connect them to your PC or laptop via USB to UART bridge. The following pictures show the required USB-UART bridge connections to CC1110 I/O connector pins:

After configuring the virtual COM port numbers associated with the receiver and transmitter boards in the GUI program, the kit is ready to intercept and send Z-Wave packets.
